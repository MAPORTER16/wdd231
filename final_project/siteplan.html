<h1>SITE NAME: Elden Builds</h1>
<img class="elden" src="images/elden.webp" alt="logo" loading="lazy" length="100" width="100">
<p>This name is relevant to the purpose of the site, becuase the website allows you to take info from Elden Ring and make personal builds for your next character.</p>

<h1>SITE PURPOSE</h1>
<p>The purpose of this site is to provide a seamless service to people who are looking for a quick and easy way to experiment with different builds in Elden Ring. There will be a page where users can select items and armor they would like for the build. Once they're done the page will tell them where they can find each item and an image will be shown on a map. There will also be a page where you can search for any item and all of its stats will show up so you can compare different items</p>

<h1>SCENARIOS</h1>
<p>1. What is the best build if my main stats are Strength and Faith?</p>

<p>2. What is the best Dexterity weapon?</p>

<p>3. Where can I find some cool armor?</p>

<p>4. What is the exact damage output of my build?</p>

<p>5. How can I make my build better?</p>

<h1>Color Scheme</h1>
<p>
    #040200: A very dark, almost black brown.
    #27170d: A rich, dark brown.
    #653815: A medium, desaturated brown.
    #bd6707: A golden-brown or bronze color.
